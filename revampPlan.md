# Project: STATA Debugger & Gamified Learning Portal

1. Project Overview
This application is a collaborative debugging platform designed for college students learning STATA. The goal is to reduce the frustration of coding by incentivizing peer-to-peer help through a "Course Points" gamification system.

The data generated by this app will eventually be exported for analysis and visualization in Tableau, allowing us to track student progress and common syntax hurdles.

2. The Points Economy (Business Logic)
The app must automatically track and award points to users based on the following triggers:
Post an Error: +5 points (User uploads a screenshot and description).
Provide a Suggestion: +3 points (User comments on a peer's post).
Solve the Problem: +5 points (Awarded to the commenter when the original poster marks their answer as "The Fix").

3. Technical Requirements

Backend (Python)
Framework: FastAPI or Flask (FastAPI preferred for modern asynchronous support).
Database: SQLite (Initial phase) or PostgreSQL.
Image Handling: Must support .png, .jpg, and .jpeg uploads.

Frontend
Option A (Fast): Streamlit (Highly recommended for rapid prototyping of data-heavy apps).
Option B (Custom): HTML/CSS with Jinja2 templates or a simple React frontend.

Data for Tableau
The database must maintain a Point_Ledger table. This table should log every point transaction with a timestamp, user ID, and "Reason" (e.g., 'POST_UPLOAD', 'ACCEPTED_SOLUTION'). This allows for time-series analysis in Tableau.

4. Database Schema (Blueprint)
Your student should implement the following structure:
Table | Key Fields
Users |	id, username, password, email, cumulative_points
Posts |	id, user_id, image_url, description, timestamp, is_resolved
Comments | 	id, post_id, user_id, text, is_verified_fix
Point_Ledger |	id, user_id, points_added, reason, timestamp

5. Starter Code (FastAPI MVP)
```python
 
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File, Form, Dependsfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, DateTimefrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_basefrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Sessionimport datetime
# Database SetupDATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./stata_app.db"engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
Base = declarative_base()
class PointLedger(Base):    __tablename__ = "point_ledger"id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(String)    points = Column(Integer)    reason = Column(String)    timestamp = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.datetime.utcnow)
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
app = FastAPI()@app.post("/log-activity/")def log_points(user: str, pts: int, reason: str):
    db = SessionLocal()
    new_entry = PointLedger(user_id=user, points=pts, reason=reason)
    db.add(new_entry)
    db.commit()
    return {"status": "Points Logged"}
```
 
6. Commercialization Goals
Scalability: The app should be built to handle multiple different classes (channels).
Anonymity: Potential feature for students to post anonymously to peers while remaining visible to the Professor/Admin.
Analytics: The data export feature is a key selling point for institutional use.
